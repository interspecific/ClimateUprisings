  <h2>Environmental Remediation and Habitat Restoration</h2>
  <p>Repairing Land, Restoring Justice, Making Polluters Pay</p>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Decades of industrial pollution and fossil fuel extraction have left U.S. communities—especially communities of color and low-income neighborhoods—contaminated and degraded. This plan lays out a strategy to clean up, restore, and revitalize these lands as an act of environmental justice and ecological renewal.</p>

    <h3>Core Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accelerate site cleanup:</strong> Prioritize Superfund and brownfield cleanups in frontline and overburdened communities.</li>
      <li><strong>Restore ecosystems:</strong> Revive wetlands, prairies, rivers, forests, and coastlines for biodiversity, carbon storage, and climate resilience.</li>
      <li><strong>Remove obsolete dams:</strong> Reconnect rivers and restore aquatic ecosystems.</li>
      <li><strong>Use bioremediation:</strong> Apply plants, fungi, and microbes for low-impact, cost-effective remediation.</li>
      <li><strong>Protect ecological corridors:</strong> Secure migration routes and habitat connectivity to reduce species extinction risks.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrate nature-based solutions:</strong> Focus on floodplain restoration, living shorelines, and green infrastructure to buffer communities from climate impacts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Polluters Must Pay</h3>
    <p>Drawing inspiration from California’s proposed <strong>Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act</strong>, we call for holding fossil fuel companies financially responsible for the damage caused by their emissions. Like the federal Superfund program, which requires polluters to cover toxic cleanups, a national Climate Superfund would ensure that the largest carbon polluters pay for climate damages, from extreme weather to public health crises, instead of leaving taxpayers and communities to shoulder the burden.</p>
    <p>Fossil fuel companies have knowingly contributed to climate change for decades, while downplaying the dangers. It’s time for accountability—to protect public health, fund ecological restoration, and build a just and resilient future.</p>

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
    <p>Environmental remediation improves public health by reducing toxic exposures, restores biodiversity, sequesters carbon, strengthens climate resilience, and supports economic revitalization. It also honors Indigenous stewardship and begins to repair the long legacy of environmental injustice.</p>

    <h3>Integrated Strategy</h3>
    <p>This work connects to urban greening, green jobs, climate mitigation, and public health—healing ecosystems and communities together, and advancing the vision of planetary health and justice.</p>
